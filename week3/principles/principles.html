		<h2>Design Principles</h2> 
	</header>

<h2>Affordance</h2>
<img src="tumblr.png" alt="Tumblr" width="500" height="200">
<p>This is an example of affordance because it is a straight forward and easy to use way of creating a new post on Tumblr.  You can tell what you can post just by looking at the options and then based on that they bring up the proper posting items for you to post with.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Chunking</h2>
<img src="disney.png" alt="Disney" width="500" height="400">
<p>The Disney website is a good example of chunking becasue of the different blocks on the page.  This is done mostly in pictures instead of text, but using pictures it makes for even easier experience and faster processing.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Signal-to-Noise Ratio</h2>
<img src="fox.png" alt="Fox Sports" width="500" height="400">
<p>Fox Sports is a good example of Signal-to-Noise Ratio because while it has a fair amount going on it is organized and easy to read.  It also has minimal adds on the page to distract you.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
<img src="seeker.png" alt="Seeker" width="500" height="400">
<p>This website shows the rule of thirds becasue when you separate the landing page into the 9 even sections it shows the balance of the page.  Elements get close and intersect the crash point.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Mapping</h2>
<img src="nascar.png" alt="Nascar Page" width="500" height="400">
<p>This fox sports nascar website is an example of mapping.  The navigation bar at the top for the fox sports website allows for easy navigation through the website.  Then under the Fox Fantasy Auto logo is the other navigation bar just for the auto fantasy site.
